# Introduction to Monitoring with Prometheus

## Prerequisites

Before we can start with the demo, we need a couple of things. Please download the following tools and make sure you choose the right platform for you (Linux, macOS, Windows, etc):

- [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases)
- [Prometheus node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases) - Not available for Windows (you can run it in a VM or in a remote Linux machine instead or try the [windows_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter))
- [Prometheus blackbox_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/releases)
- [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases)
- [Mailslurper](https://github.com/mailslurper/mailslurper/releases) - Development SMTP mail server for receiving alert mails
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/download) - Shiny dashboards for our metrics
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Required for examples in chapter 3 and 5

For all tutorials, I expect you have either installed those files somewhere in your `$PATH`, otherwise please prefix commands with the installation directory accordingly. Windows users, don't forget to add `.exe` to the commands. ðŸ˜‰

If you have any trouble with the examples or find that something's missing, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/fhemberger/prometheus-beginner-workshop/issues/new) or submit a PR. And now, let's get started â€¦
